# Luitpoldpark Website

This project is is to create a website for the Luitpold park in Munich. The website provides a short description of the park, its location, and its history. 
It also contains a list of all popular activities and beer gardens in the park. Last but not least, the website has a gallery page included, showcasing all beauties of the park in different seasons. 


### UX

The project was designed to promote the Luitpold park, to tourists and the locals alike. Throughout the site we have a visible navbar with it pages clearly marked, which enables the visitors to chose straight away what they're interested in, without having to go trough all the pages.
A lot of tourists love to visit historical marks when in a foreign city. That's why our website includes a short but powerful story of the park, with instructions of how to get to the park. 
Together with the historical story of the park, the home page contains a slide show of the park in different seasons, showing a different side of the park to the tourists.
The second page lists all activities one is able to do in the park, whether for laisure or sport. This way, the website incourages its visitors to visit the park and enjoy their free time in the open.
The Beer Garden page shows the beer gardens that are in the park. It is a fast way to find a certain beer garden's address, working hours and phone number. At the bottom we have included a youtube video of a traditinal german beer garden, to give a sneak peek to the tourists of what to expect.
The Gallery page serves as an inspiration to the tourists to come and visit the Luitpoldpark, while at the same time reminds the locals of the beautiful park right in their neighbourhood.
The website also contains social media links to facebook, youtube and instagram, where the visitors can further research all the park's amenities.
