# Luitpoldpark Website

This project is is to create a website for the Luitpold park in Munich. The website provides a short description of the park, its location, and its history. 
It also contains a list of all popular activities and beer gardens in the park. Last but not least, the website has a gallery page included, showcasing all beauties of the park in different seasons. 


## UX

The project was designed to promote the Luitpold park, to tourists and the locals alike. Throughout the site we have a visible navbar with it pages clearly marked, which enables the visitors to chose straight away what they're interested in, without having to go trough all the pages.
A lot of tourists love to visit historical marks when in a foreign city. That's why our website includes a short but powerful story of the park, with instructions of how to get to the park. 
Together with the historical story of the park, the home page contains a slide show of the park in different seasons, showing a different side of the park to the tourists.
The second page lists all activities one is able to do in the park, whether for laisure or sport. This way, the website incourages its visitors to visit the park and enjoy their free time in the open.
The Beer Garden page shows the beer gardens that are in the park. It is a fast way to find a certain beer garden's address, working hours and phone number. At the bottom we have included a youtube video of a traditinal german beer garden, to give a sneak peek to the tourists of what to expect.
The Gallery page serves as an inspiration to the tourists to come and visit the Luitpoldpark, while at the same time reminds the locals of the beautiful park right in their neighbourhood.
The website also contains social media links to facebook, youtube and instagram, where the visitors can further research all the park's amenities.

### Testing

To ensure that the website doesn't have any bugs or layout issues and that all the links and media are working, we ran following tests:

#### Page Links

- when on index.html - click on Activities Link to verify it brings me to the Activities page.
- when on activities.html - click on Beer Gardens link to verify it brings me to the Beer Gardens page.
- when on beer_gardens.html - click on Gallery link to verify it brings me to the Gallery page. 
- when on gallery.html - click on Home link to verify it brings me to the Home page. 

#### Social Media

-click on Facebook icon in Footer and verify that the correct page opens in a new tab.
-click on YouTube icon in Footer and verify that the correct page opens in a new tab.
-click on Instagram icon in Footer and verify that the correct page opens in a new tab.


#### Videos

- click on the play button and verify that the video plays.
- click on the pause button and verify that the video pauses.
- click on the progress bar to change the timing position of the video and verify that the video plays correctly.
- mute the volume and verify that the volume mutes.
- change the volume to lowest setting and verify that the video cannot be heard.
- make the video full screen and then back to regular size and verify that there are no issues.


#### Responsivness

- view site on "Galaxy S5" sizeand verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPhone 5/SE" size and verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPhone 6/7/8" size and verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPhone 6/7/8 Plus" size and verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPhone X" size and verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPad" sizeand verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "iPad Pro" sizeand verify that there are no viewing issues
- view site on "desktop" and verify that there are no viewing issues

The website scales correctly on all screen sizes. The navbar is desgined to toggle when on mobile view, so to not take up too much of the screen real estate.


#### Bugs

During the development phase we've met with a range of layout issues, media not being uploaded correctly, etc. However, these all have been worked at and fixed. 
To the best of my knowledge, there are no known issues in the final product. A small exception would be one of the pictures on activities.html not being the same size as the rest of the pictures on the page.
